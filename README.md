Minishell is a simple and lightweight shell, coded from scratch, which emulates several functionalities from `bash`.

## Project specifications

This shell covers the following functionalities:

- Show a prompt when waiting for a new command
- Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or by using relative or absolute path) like in bash
- Implement some `builtins` like in bash:
    - `echo` with option ’-n’
    - `cd` with only a relative or absolute path
    - `pwd` without any options
    - `export` without any options
    - `unset` without any options
    - `env` without any options and any arguments
    - `exit` without any options
- `;` in the command separates commands like in bash
- `’` and `"` like in bash except for multiline commands
- Redirections `< > “>>”` like in bash except for file descriptor aggregation
- `Pipes |` like in bash except for multiline commands
- `Environment variables` like in bash
- `$?` like in bash
- `ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D` and `ctrl-\` have same result as in bash
